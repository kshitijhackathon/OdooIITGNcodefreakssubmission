# Logo Fix Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed:

### 1. Logo Not Loading
- **Problem:** Logo files were in `attached_assets/` but Vite couldn't serve them properly
- **Solution:** Copied logo files to `client/public/attached_assets/` where Vite can serve them
- **Files:** `whitelogo.png` and `Blacklogo.png` now accessible

### 2. Button Glitch (Black Flash)
- **Problem:** `active-elevate-2` class was causing black flash on button click
- **Solution:** Changed to `active-elevate` (less intense elevation effect)
- **Result:** Smoother button interactions without black flash

## 🎯 Current Status:
✅ **Logo Files:** Properly placed in public directory
✅ **Theme Detection:** Working (light/dark mode)
✅ **Button Glitch:** Fixed
✅ **Console Logging:** Added for debugging

## 🚀 Test Instructions:
1. Run: `npm run dev`
2. Check console for logo load messages
3. Toggle theme to see logo change
4. Click buttons to verify no black flash
5. Check both navbar and login page logos
